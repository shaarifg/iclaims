A claim management system for a hospital is a software application that helps hospital staff manage the process of submitting and tracking insurance claims for patients' medical treatment. It typically includes features such as the ability to input patient and insurance information, track the status of claims, and communicate with insurance companies to resolve any issues that may arise. The goal of a claim management system is to streamline the billing process and ensure that patients are accurately charged for their treatment and that the hospital is reimbursed by insurance companies in a timely manner.
